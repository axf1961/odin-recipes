    <h4>Ribeye with mashed potatoes</h4>
    <p>
        A ribeye steak with mashed potatoes is a classic and mouthwatering combination 
        that brings together the rich flavors of a perfectly cooked steak and the creamy 
        comfort of mashed potatoes.

        The star of the dish is the ribeye steak, which is a prime cut of beef known for 
        its marbling and tenderness. The ribeye is characterized by its rich, juicy, and 
        flavorful meat, with beautiful fat marbling that adds succulence and depth of flavor. 
        It is typically grilled, pan-seared, or broiled to achieve a caramelized crust on the outside 
        while maintaining a tender and juicy interior.

    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds of Yukon gold potatoes(diced)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3/4 cup of heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 table spoon of vegatable oil</li>
        <li>1 boneless ribeye steak(room tempature)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup brandy</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 handful parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the diced potatoes to a large pot of salted water and bring to a boil. Cook until the potatoes are fork-tender, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan on low, heat the butter and 1/2 cup of heavy cream until just warmed through.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat the vegetable oil in a cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Season both sides of the rib-eye generously with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Carefully lay the steak into the hot oil and cook 5 minutes per side, or until it reaches desired temperature. Remove the steak to a plate to rest.</li>
        <li>With the pan still on low heat, carefully add in the brandy to deglaze the pan. The brandy may catch fire so stand back and allow it to extinguish itself as it begins to reduce down.</li>
        <li>Pour in the chicken stock and remaining 1/4 cup of heavy cream and allow the sauce to reduce until thickened, about 2-3 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is reducing, strain the boiled potatoes and pass them through a ricer into a large bowl. No need to peel the potatoes; the ricer will do all the work for you.</li>
        <li>Gently fold the warmed butter and cream mixture into the potatoes.</li>
        <li>Slice the steak against the grain, drizzle with the sauce, and top with roughly chopped parsley. Serve alongside creamy mashed potatoes.</li>
    </ol>
