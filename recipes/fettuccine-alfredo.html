    <h4>Fettuccine Alfredo</h4>
    <p>
        This is a classic Italian pasta dish known for its rich, creamy
        , and indulgent flavors. The dish typically consists of fettuccine pasta noodles 
        tossed in a sauce made primarily of butter, Parmesan cheese, and heavy cream. 
        The sauce is smooth and velvety, coating the strands of pasta to create a luscious and satisfying dish.

    <ul>
        <li>1 lb Fettuccine Pasta</li>
        <li>6 Tablespoons Butter</li>
        <li>1 Garlic Clove(minced)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups Heavy Creme</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon Salt</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cup Shredded Parmesan Chees</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon Pepper</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons of Italian Parsely(optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, heat water over high heat until boiling. Add salt to season the water. Once it is boiling, add fettuccine and cook according to package instructions. </li>
        <li>In a large skillet or pan, heat butter over medium heat. Add minced garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in heavy cream. </li>
        <li>Let heavy cream reduce and cook for 5 to 8 minutes. Add half of the parmesan cheese to the mixture and whisk well until smooth. Keep over heat and whisk well until cheese is melted.</li>
        <li>Save some pasta water. The pasta water is full of flavor and can be used to thin out the sauce.</li>
        <li>Toss alfredo sauce with fettuccine pasta and add half of the parmesan cheese. Once it is tossed, garnish with the remaining parmesan cheese. Add a little pasta water if it needs to be thinned out.</li>
        <li>Garnish with Italian parsley and any remaining parmesan, if so desired.</li>
    </ol>
